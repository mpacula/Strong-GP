; a simple statically-typed scheme-like language. Used to evaluate the expressiveness and
; adequacy of the metalanguage.

; define types first

types {
      ; numeric types
      Number
      Integer derives Number
      Double derives Number

      ; character types
      Char
      String

      ; the basic types defined above are covariant, i.e. all Integers are Numbers but not vice-versa

      ; parametrized types. Parametrized types accept one or more other types and are invariant
      List a ; a can be any other type
      Pair a b ; a and b can be of any type

      ; the language will also allow chained types, which are especially useful for methods.
      ; For example, given the types above Number -> String is also a valid type, as is
      ; Number -> String -> List Number
}
